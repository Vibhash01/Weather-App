This project is a simple Weather App built using HTML and CSS that allows users to check the weather conditions of any city they input.

API: The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for the entered city. It uses asynchronous JavaScript (async/await) to fetch the data and update the UI dynamically.

Usage: To use this Weather App:

Enter the name of a city in the input field. Click the search button. The app will display the current weather conditions of the entered city, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, along with an appropriate weather icon. If the city name is invalid or not found, an error message will be displayed.

Future Scope: Additionally, we can further enhance the app by adding features such as multiple-day forecasts, geolocation-based weather, or unit conversion options.
